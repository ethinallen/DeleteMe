### Spring 2021 New Graduate Positions
My name is Andrew Emery, but you can call me Drew. I am a senior at Clemson University and am seeking full-time employment starting this summer. I completed an internship at [AWS](https://github.com/aws) this summer and received my cloud practitioner certification while learning how to delight customers. I also worked on a team of interns to build a tool to facilitate easier cloud migrations. You can download my resume by clicking [here](https://misc-site-storage.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/drewEmeryResume.pdf). I am open to all software engineering, systems development, or cloud consulting positions available. It is my hope that my experience shows my ability to learn whatever is necessary to deliver results and earn the trust of my team.

Feel free to reach out using the contact information in my resume.

Best,   
Drew
